TODO:
Change destructable-behavior to support custom "destruction" effects (especially for player)

level generation
  !!! Remove test-button for level loading
  more settings (each floor different)
  enemy spawns in room definition
  multiple end-rooms (+ start rooms?)
  special rooms + limits? -> otherwise spawn specials in any room
  ? prevent generation instead of blocking later -> at least has to connect to existing rooms
  ? weighted room randomness
  Replace room::tile-type with tiles::tile-type

VFX
  visual effects (flashes on hit) -> add color tint to shader (implement like model-mats)
      -> second buffer for colors (or maybe interleaved in one?)
      -> slot IDs have to match up, but model mats don't need updating when color changes
      -> how to handle updates? -> static/dynamic position != color -> all colors dynamic? or selective updates directly to buffer?
  partial transparency
  light?

main gameplay
  upgrades
  enemy behaviors (line-of-sight checks -> add to simple movement as optional condition, pathfinding)
  ladder(?) to next floor
  main menu
  fog-of-war?
  minimap?
  saving? -> simplest solution would be on a per-floor basis (only needs floor counter, resources (e.g. health), random-state(s))
  audio(?)
  modular attacks(?)

collisions with mask (whitelist/blacklist tags) -> enemies should pass through player but not walls
remove *game-object-sprites*

Optimisations (performance):
Rendering
  partial updates for static render objects
  keep c-pointer (or directly edit buffer)
  gtk4
Collisions
  circle-aabb collision early return
  smarter collsions (space partitioning (sort and sweep: https://www.toptal.com/game/video-game-physics-part-ii-collision-detection-for-solid-objects) (+ broad phase?))
  separate x and y collision checks (currently both done twice)
  replace distance with square of distance
use with-vec?

Optimisations (usability):
? split texture into renderer + texture
all tags in one namespace?
behaviors in separate system?

Known bugs / inconsistencies:
should collision resolution result in countinuous collision?
      in general: (consistency) should distance=0 result in collision
static sprites added later (stairs object) -> sometimes some sprites get "deleted" (?)
